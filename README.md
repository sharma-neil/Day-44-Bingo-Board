Day 44 Bingo Board

Today's challenge is to create a bingo card. Oh yes, because programming's not just for you hip, young cats. ðŸ˜†

Anyway, your challenge is to enable "gambling for the elderly" (aka Bingo), and you'll achieve it like this:

Randomly generate a series of number between 0 and 90.
Allocate each number to a place in a 2D list.
The numbers should be in numerical order, left to right.
Numbers should not be repeated.
The center square should not contain a number. It should contain the word 'BINGO!'.
When the program is run, the bingo card should be displayed on screen.

It's time for more bingo! You can reuse your code from day 43, but this time add the following features:

Repeatedly ask the user what number comes up next.
Check the bingo card to see if the number picked matches one on the card.
If the bingo card is all 'X's, then the user has won.
